## zoo
This repository contains configuration packages of various quadrupedal robots generated by CHAMP's [setup assistant](https://github.com/chvmp/champ_setup_assistant).

## Installation

### URDF
There's a list of resources where you can download the URDF file of the robot you need in *[install_descriptions](https://github.com/chvmp/robots/blob/master/install_descriptions)* file. Alternatively, you can run:

    ./install_descriptions

to download all the URDFs at once.

### Quick Start Guide

You can find the pre-configured robots in [configs](https://github.com/chvmp/robots/tree/master/configs) folder. There's an auto-generated README in every configuration package that contains instructions on how to run the demos.

Please take note that although the README may contain instructions how to run in Gazebo, only the following pre-configured robots work in Gazebo:

- Open Quadruped
- OpenDog V2
- MIT Mini Cheetah
- Boston Dynamic's Spot
