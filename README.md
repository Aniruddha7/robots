## zoo
This repository contains configuration packages of various quadrupedal robots generated by CHAMP's [setup assistant](https://github.com/chvmp/champ).

You can find the download links for every robot in install_descriptions if you want to install the URDF individually. Alternatively, you can run:

    ./install_descriptions

to download all URDFs at once.

Choose the robot you want to use in configs folder and follow the instructions in their respective READMEs.

## Instructions

There's an auto-generated README in every configuration package that contains instructions how to run the demos specific to that package.

Please take note that although the README may contain instructions how to run in Gazebo, only the following pre-configured robots work in Gazebo:

- Open Quadruped
- OpenDog V2
- MIT Mini Cheetah
- Boston Dynamic's Spot
